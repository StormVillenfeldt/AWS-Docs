Shared Responsibility Model:
The Shared Responsibility Model (SRM) is a model describing which parts of the services selected that the client is responsible for, and which AWS is responsible for. This is almost always a trade-off situation, where the client has to choose between flexibility and more customization, or simplicity. There is no answer to which is better, and this is more often than not completely dependet on the customer. App-developers who only wants to focus on creating an app and making it available would like to avoid being responsible for things such as security, connectivity and storage. However, a major tech company would probably want to be much more in control of every single alternative, and build their own tools based on AWS services.
